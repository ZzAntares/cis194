* About the repo

These are the solutions to the exercises from the course [[http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/][CIS 194: Introduction
to Haskell (Spring 2013)]] taught at the University of Pennsylvania by Brent
Yorgey.

The =Demo.hs= file is just code to test stuff explained in the lessons, is not
part of the exercises per se.
